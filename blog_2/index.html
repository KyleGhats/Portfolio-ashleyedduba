                The Philippine National Police (PNP) has launched a new program,
                KASIMBAYANAN, which aims to foster a synergized partnership
                between the PNP and the general public and religious sectors.
                The program, which stands for Kapulisan, Simbahan, and
                Pamayanan, was launched on September 19 at Camp Crame in Quezon
                City.
              </p>
              <p class="highlight-txt">
                PNP Chief, General Rodolfo S. Azurin, Jr., spoke at the launch,
                emphasizing the importance of religion in shaping the culture
                and traditions of the PNP. He stated that the foundation of a
                strong national police force begins with a virtuous police
                officer who loves their family, respects others, fears God,
                loves their country, and is loyal in their service. He also
                emphasized that this is necessary for effective service to the
                community. The event featured the distribution and pinning of
                the KASIMBAYANAN button pin to PNP personnel and partners from
                the Department of the Interior and Local Government, Catholic
                Bishops Conference of the Philippines, Imam Council of the
                Philippines, Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches of the
                Philippines, Inc., and Kaisa Para sa Kaunlaran, Inc./Movement
                for Restoration of Peace and Order. This symbolizes the
                recognition that both the police and the community have a vital
                role in contributing to peace, order, and progress.
                Additionally, the PNP jingle "Life is Beautiful" was introduced
                and sung by all attendees. The jingle serves as a call for hope
                and unity, bringing the PNP and the community together towards
                progress and addressing peace and security in the country with
                respect for human rights and the rule of law.
              </p>
              <p class="highlight-txt">
                The launch ceremonies concluded with a forum on the
                implementation of the revitalized PNP Kasimbayan program for
                faith-based volunteers. The forum emphasized the importance of
                unity and cooperation between different sectors of government
                and society in order to successfully implement laws and programs
                that benefit the majority of people. PNP Chief Azurin emphasized
                that the PNP is committed to God, country, and people as
                professional law enforcers and will work to strengthen
                police-community relations by fostering genuine concern,
                compassion, and assistance. He stated that together, the PNP and
                community can accomplish a job worth doing and a success worth
                reaching.
