                      Recently, we had the privilege of listening to guest
                      speaker
                      <b>Mr. Ariel Tenorio</b>(President, of Love without
                      Borders) speak on the topic of &quot;Public Speaking about
                      Being a Public Safety Officer.&quot; Mr. Tenorio&#39;s
                      words were informative and inspiring, as he shared with us
                      his personal experiences and insights on the importance of
                      public speaking in the field of public safety.
                    </p>
                    <p class="highlight-txt">
                      Mr. Tenorio began his presentation by highlighting the
                      crucial role that public speaking plays in the job of a
                      public safety officer. He emphasized that, as a public
                      safety officer, one must possess the ability to speak in a
                      clear and concise manner, particularly when addressing the
                      public during emergencies. The ability to convey accurate
                      information quickly and effectively can mean the
                      difference between life and death. He also shared that
                      speaking persuasively is important when working on
                      community outreach programs or trying to gain a
                      suspect&#39;s or witness&#39;s trust. He went on to
                      discuss the importance of being able to speak confidently
                      and persuasively in front of a group of people, which is
                      crucial for building trust and maintaining positive
                      relationships with the community. Mr. Tenorio shared that,
                      he has had to give numerous presentations and training
                      sessions and that the ability to speak confidently and
                      persuasively is essential to effectively convey important
                      information and gain the support and cooperation of his
                      audience. He also emphasized that the ability to speak
                      persuasively is important when trying to gain the support
                      of community leaders and decision-makers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="highlight-txt">
                      Furthermore, Mr. Tenorio emphasized that the art of public
                      speaking is not only about the words you say but also
                      about the way you present yourself. He stressed that as a
                      public safety officer, one must maintain a professional
                      demeanor and appearance at all times, which includes
                      dressing appropriately, maintaining good eye contact, and
                      using appropriate body language and gestures. By
                      professionally presenting oneself, a public safety officer
                      can gain the respect and trust of the community, which is
                      crucial for building positive relationships. One of the
                      most striking moments of Mr. Tenorio&#39;s presentation
                      was when he shared a personal story of how he had to speak
                      in front of a large crowd during a critical emergency. He
                      spoke about how he had to remain calm and composed while
                      addressing the crowd, and how his ability to speak clearly
                      and persuasively helped ease the people&#39;s panic and
                      fear. He shared that the experience not only tested his
                      public speaking skills but also his leadership and
                      decision-making abilities. The story left an indelible
                      impression on the audience, and it highlighted the
                      importance of public speaking in the field of public
                      safety.
                    </p>
                    <p class="highlight-txt">
                      In conclusion, Mr. Ariel Tenorio&#39;s presentation was a
                      powerful reminder of the vital role that public speaking
                      plays in the job of a public safety officer. His personal
                      experiences and insights highlighted the importance of
                      being able to speak confidently and persuasively, not only
                      in emergencies but also in community outreach programs and
                      when trying to gain the support of community leaders and
                      decision-makers. Furthermore, by professionally presenting
                      oneself, a public safety officer can gain the respect and
                      trust of the community, which is crucial for building
                      positive relationships. Mr. Tenorio&#39;s words were
                      informative and inspiring, and they left us with a deeper
                      understanding of the importance of public speaking in the
                      field of public safety.
