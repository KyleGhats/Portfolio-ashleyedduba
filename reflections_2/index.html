                    <p class="highlight-txt">
                      On January 12, 2023, the Philippine National Police Academy
                      (PNPA) in Silang, Cavite, held a seminar on leadership
                      experience with Atty. Siegfred B. Mison. The event, held at
                      the Heroes Hall at Camp General Mariano N. Castañeda, was
                      attended by a diverse group of individuals, all united in
                      their desire to learn more about the principles of
                      leadership and how to apply them in their daily lives.
                    </p>
                    <p class="highlight-txt">
                      One of the main topics of discussion was the fear of failure
                      and how it can often hold individuals back from reaching
                      their full potential as leaders. Atty. Mison highlighted the
                      importance of recognizing and overcoming this fear in order
                      to become more effective and successful leaders. He also
                      touched on the importance of humility and how a leader who
                      is willing to share power with others is often more
                      respected and admired than one who insists on always being
                      in control. Another key topic was the importance of servant
                      leadership, which is founded on four principles: that we are
                      all leaders and we are leading all the time, whether well or
                      poorly; that leadership springs from within and is about who
                      we are as much as what we do; that it is not an act but
                      rather a way of living and an ongoing process; and that true
                      leadership is about serving others rather than seeking power
                      or status for oneself.
                    </p>
                    <p class="highlight-txt">
                      As the seminar progressed, attendees were given the
                      opportunity to reflect on their own leadership experiences
                      and to share their insights with one another. Many spoke
                      about how they had struggled with the fear of failure and
                      how they had learned to overcome it by focusing on their
                      strengths and building on them. Others shared how they had
                      learned to let go of their pride, arrogance, and attachment
                      to things like money, status, or job titles, and how this
                      had allowed them to become more effective leaders. The
                      seminar was not just informative but also inspiring, as it
                      allowed the attendees to learn and grow as leaders. Atty.
                      Mison’s insight on how to be a better leader, especially on
                      the principles of servant leadership, was truly
                      enlightening. The attendees were reminded that we all have
                      the potential to be great leaders and that it is up to each
                      of us to take the steps necessary to reach that potential.
                    </p>
                    <p class="highlight-txt">
                      In conclusion, the seminar on leadership experiences with
                      Atty. Siegfred B. Mison was an enlightening and empowering
                      experience for all attendees. The insights shared by Atty.
                      Mison, the open discussion, and the opportunity to reflect
                      on their own leadership experiences helped the attendees
                      gain a deeper understanding of the principles of leadership
                      and how to apply them in their daily lives. The seminar
                      serves as a reminder that we are all capable of being great
                      leaders and that it is up to each of us to take the steps
                      necessary to reach our full potential.
