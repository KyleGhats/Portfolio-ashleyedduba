                    <p class="highlight-txt">
                      Knowing yourself is the most fundamental thing to consider
                      in developing a sense of leadership. Knowing yourself or
                      oneself simply refers to evaluating your strengths and
                      weaknesses, evaluating and specifying your capabilities
                      and skills, scrutinizing yourself, and identifying your
                      traits that need some improvement. A good leader must
                      evaluate himself first before evaluating his subordinates.
                      As a leader, your followers will always look up to you,
                      will idolize you, and will follow you but how they can
                      follow you if even you can’t even improve yourself? A
                      leader is always learning from his mistakes and
                      experiences, always grows up from his past, and has always
                      room for improvement. A leader should not only be
                      scrutinizing to his subordinates but also himself.
                    </p>
                    <p class="highlight-txt">
                      We all know that a leader is a foundation, the source, the
                      main pillar, and the head of an organization. Before
                      leading other people, a leader must know how to lead
                      himself. He must know how to decide accordingly, face
                      challenges, and deal with the challenges he is facing for
                      he knows himself and he already evaluated himself.

                    <p class="highlight-txt">
                      Leading a group, small or big, is not an easy task or
                      responsibility. It requires a lot of patience and
                      perseverance. Self-improvement is the key in order to
                      becoming an effective and efficient leader.

                  Be technically and tactically proficient
                </h4>
                <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-center">
                  <div class="highlight-txt-box">
                    <p class="highlight-txt">
                      A good leader needs to be a good example to his followers.
                      There are many skills and characteristics that one must
                      possess for him to be called a great leader but there are
                      two skills that I believe if one has, then he will already
                      be a good leader and that is being technically and
                      tactically proficient. Technically and tactically are both
                      broad terms but both are what a leader specifically should
                      have formed. Technicality-wise, one should know how things
                      should be done, what proper ways to do a specific task
                      should one consider, and the proper things to use. Also,
                      technicality also includes one’s creativity and
                      innovativeness as a person because being technical
                      requires being proper yet artsy in a way. Tactically on
                      the other hand is more focused on how strong and effective
                      a person is while doing the tasks assigned to him. Tactics
                      equate to different activities that require a lot of
                      energy and effort. If one is tactically proficient, then
                      it means that he can do things thoroughly even under
                      pressure and even how many tasks he is doing at the same
                      time. Also, it means that one is not just mentally fit but
                      also physically fit.
                    </p>
                    <p class="highlight-txt">
                      If one is able to possess all the skills mentioned above
                      then he can already be considered technically and
                      tactically proficient and can now be called a great
                      leader. All in all, a leader should start to believe in
                      his own skills first for him to absorb the confidence to
                      lead and influence others.

                  Seek responsibility and take responsibility for your actions

                      With great power comes with great responsibility” this is
                      a famous quote from the movie “Spiderman”. The more
                      authority you have, the more responsibility you handle. As
                      a future leader, it is already given that you’re going to
                      handle not only one or two but a lot of people, with
                      different perspectives and characters. You can’t be a
                      leader overnight, and you can’t be a good one if you don’t
                      have the courage and determination to be a responsible
                      one.
                    </p>
                    <p class="highlight-txt">
                      Comes with responsibility is decision-making- a trait that
                      every leader must acquire. With every choice you make
                      regarding every situation, whether positive or negative
                      stand still with it and take responsibility, may it be
                      good or bad. I can still remember back when I was in high
                      school, we had a group activity wherein we were instructed
                      to grow a plant. Our group leader volunteered that she
                      will be the one to bring the pot and soil for us to have
                      our activity the day it was scheduled. Comes that day, she
                      was not able to bring it because she left it in the
                      vehicle that she rode on that to school. As a good leader,
                      she took responsibility regardless of the situation and
                      immediately found a solution so we can comply with our
                      activity. It serves as a motivation and an eye-opener for
                      me that not all leaders are up high. They also go down low
                      but it will depend on the person on how they will react to
                      the situation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="highlight-txt">
                      Another situation that comes to mind is about the leader
                      who seeks responsibility because he/she wants the
                      betterment of the team. Prior to entering the academy. I
                      was a college graduate and since I am planning on entering
                      the academy, I wanted to test my leadership capabilities.
                      Instead of being just a mere member of the company, I have
                      decided to be the Foxtrot Company Commander to bring our
                      company to success. With this, I realized that being a
                      leader is fulfilling especially when you have learned to
                      appreciate and accepted the art of seeking and taking
                      responsibility for your actions.

                      LEADER, a single word that has a deep and heavy
                      responsibility, as a leader we are the ones who will lead.
                      Teach and hone your subordinates on becoming a leader
                      also. You are the one responsible for their actions
                      because you are the one they are relying upon. How to
                      become a good leader? There are 11 leadership principles
                      that one must know. One of the leadership principles is
                      “set the example”. A good leader is a good example. Your
                      subordinates follow what you say, do or instruct them,
                      that is why you should lead as an example. Some think that
                      a leader is a boss, prove them wrong because you, as a
                      leader should not only pass the work to your subordinates
                      but make them look up to you more and idolize you by
                      becoming a servant leader. Do other works so they can have
                      an example to follow. Being a leader is not easy, it has
                      positive and negative effects on one’s self. But learning
                      how to overcome and control it makes you a good leader.
                      Doing the best things, choosing the good decision, having
                      concern for your constituents, and knowing what&#39;s best
                      for the welfare of your subordinates are only a few
                      characteristics of a leader that one should follow and set
                      as an example. Think of a way how will you become a better
                      leader than you are now. If you want to improve if you
                      want your subordinates to be better also, start making
                      ways on improving yourself so you can be a better example
                      for them. Love and concern for one another make
                      camaraderie possible. If there is camaraderie in your
                      circle of work, the task you are doing to disseminate will
                      be easily accomplished.

                      of competitiveness. Moreover, enlightenment of the team’s
                      spirit, capabilities, and determination identify a larger
                      potential for growth and motivation. Therefore, means of
                      leading is important, as choosing a diverse style of
                      management and effective reward or punishment-based
                      system. In analysis, a pragmatic approach of encouragement
                      is essential for portraying a reasonable act of complying
                      with what is necessary and those who neglect have their
                      outcomes. Compatibility is the reason why people engage,
                      relate, and communicate to the terms and conditions wanted
                      by each individual. The process comes as they learn

                      because of the individual desire to have something. But,
                      with the correct use of influence. We can actualize the
                      use of power creating an efficient management style for
                      controlling the team. Having control can identify

                      special roles that enable the rest of the team to become
                      successful. A snappy leader knows how to impart to his
                      members that are more effective to strive together than to
                      make efforts of your own. An effective leader foresight
                      that the skills of every member of his or her team, when
                      put together, have a big impact that will dictate the
                      success or failure of the whole team.

                    <p class="highlight-txt">
                      Now that the leader successfully imparts to his or her
                      members the real essence and importance of working hand in
                      hand, almost anything is possible now once a new task or
                      goal needs to be materialized. Training one’s people as a
                      team thus promote growth among its members and if we talk
                      about the growth the people belonging to the team are not
                      just mere members, how they also become leaders in their
                      own fields.

                      A series of deliberation and extreme consideration of all
                      circumstances is what leads to a decision that is
                      difficult to make and this kind of difficulty is the
                      responsibility of a leader to take on every challenge.
                      Leaders have to make sound and timely decisions. A sound
                      that is acceptable, humane, and comprehensive, and that
                      does not abuse or take advantage of any given
                      circumstance. Timely, that is relevant in that it is
                      within the concept of the given time period, not out of
                      date, and productive in every way and event possible.
                      Decisions are already difficult to make, how else more if
                      it is expected, and should the ensue to be sound and
                      timely?

                    <p class="highlight-txt">
                      Decisions are the deciding factor of a course of action to
                      be taken by a group. Lousy decisions lead to the failure
                      of the group. Such implements an idea of fear or doubt of
                      oneself in making decisions. That means to say that not
                      only a leader has to brace themselves for the challenge of
                      making decisions but also have the confidence and ability
                      to convince themselves and their subordinates to go
                      through with the decision.

                    <p class="highlight-txt">
                      The decision builds trust among leaders and their
                      subordinates. A decision that brings success to the group
                      establishes a certain bond of trust and admiration that
                      develops the camaraderie of the group.

                      Making decisions is crucial for the betterment and
                      stability of a group. A leader has to have initiative,
                      critical thinking, confidence, and deep empathy to make
                      sound and timely decisions.

                      We are all aware that everyone is gifted with skills and
                      talents that make us stand out as individuals. As leaders
                      of small groups, it is our duty to hone the skills and
                      talents of our subordinates. We need not demand their
                      maximum best but help them improve and escalate to the
                      next level. As leaders, we shouldn’t disregard the skills
                      that they have and try to know our subordinates better by
                      asking them about their skills and talents. It is our duty
                      as leaders to formulate activities and pieces of training
                      that will help our subordinates achieve the best training
                      that would equip them with knowledge and skill as they
                      will further in life. We have to look after our
                      subordinates and their welfare and despite wanting their
                      best in everything, we have to think that we shouldn’t
                      demand a lot from them but perhaps, aid them in achieving
                      the best results. When a leader comes for his people, he
                      allows each of them to thrive and embrace their talent
                      more than they ever did.
